                        Google just concluded its I/O 2017 keynote, where executives led by CEO Sundar 
                        Pichai laid out the company’s future roadmap for Android, Google Assistant, 
                        Google Home, virtual reality, and much more.
                        Skydiving Google Glass-wearers, giant phone giveaways, and major 
                        hardware announcements no longer rule Google’s biggest annual conference. 
                        Instead, the company has settled into a pattern of releasing information 
                        about what it’s doing (and what it wants to do) for developers at I/O, instead of 
                        trying to wow consumers or the press.
                        You might call that boring, but that’s also a misguided notion, because there was 
                        much to glean from Pichai and the rest of the Googlers who presented onstage. So here 
                        are the 10 most important takeaways from today’s I/O keynote.

                    <h4>ANDROID SURPASSES 2 BILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE DEVICES</h4>
                    <p>
                        Android’s mobile dominance hasn’t stopped growing. CEO Sundar Pichai 
                        revealed at the keynote’s start that the tally of monthly active Android 
                        devices now exceeds 2 billion. That includes smartphones, tablets, Android 
                        Wear devices, Android TVs, and any other number of other gadgets that 
                        are based on the operating system.
                    </p>
            
                    <h4>GOOGLE ASSISTANT CAN SEE AND UNDERSTAND THE WORLD AROUND YOU</h4>
                    <p>
                        Google Assistant can now analyze the world around you with the help of your 
                        smartphone camera. Using a technology the company calls Google Lens, the 
                        Assistant will analyze your surroundings and display relevant content on 
                        your screen. You’ll see a restaurant’s rating when pointing your phone at 
                        the storefront, you can aim it at a flower and it will identify the species, 
                        and you can even pull up a band’s music or videos by pointing Lens at a 
                        concert poster. But the most useful example might be this: if you point 
                        Lens at Wi-Fi login credentials, your Android phone will be able to use 
                        that info to log on to that network. (Thank you, Google.)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Google’s not the first company to try to add artificial intelligence to a 
                        smartphone’s camera. Samsung recently launched “Bixby Vision” on the Galaxy 
                        S8, a sight-based version of its own Bixby digital assistant, for example. And 
                        Snapchat (and now Instagram) are using low-level AI to apply goofy filters to 
                        your face. But Google’s offering much more with Lens than just image recognition, 
                        shopping, or face filters. And while Facebook is exploring similar computer 
                        vision efforts, Google is trying to do it sooner than later with Lens.
                    </p>
            
                    <h4>GOOGLE ASSISTANT COMES TO IPHONE</h4>
                    <p>
                        Assistant is expanding beyond Android to iOS. Google Assistant will be a 
                        standalone app on iPhone and iPad, offering many of the same functions as 
                        what we’ve seen it do on Google’s own operating system. You don’t have to 
                        wait long to try it, either; it’s available starting today.

                    <h4>GOOGLE HOME TURNS INTO A PHONE</h4>
                    <p>
                        Like Amazon, Google is turning its smart speaker into a phone. Over the 
                        coming months, all Home owners will be able to place free calls to the 
                        United States and Canada. By default, Google uses a private number for 
                        this feature — but you’ve got the option of tying it to your own mobile 
                        phone number. The same goes for everyone else in your house, as phone 
                        calls support Home’s multi-user setup. Only outgoing calls will be available 
                        at launch, as Google is taking a cautious approach to avoid privacy headaches.
                    </p>
            
                    <h4>HOME GETS WAY MORE USEFUL</h4>
                    <p>
                        Google’s smart speaker was already one of the best ones on the market, but 
                        the company announced a suite of other new features and updates beyond calling 
                        to Home that make it much more powerful. Home is now going to be able to control 
                        HBO Now, Hulu, SoundCloud, Deezer, and more. Even better, Google is opening up 
                        access to Home’s Bluetooth radio, meaning you can treat it just like any other 
                        Bluetooth speaker.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        HOME NOW ACTS AS A PHONE, CAN CONNECT OVER BLUETOOTH, AND GETS NEW 
                        COMPATIBILITY WITH SERVICES LIKE HBO AND HULU
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Home is also becoming more useful away from the device itself. 
                        Google showed off what it’s calling “visual responses.” Using Google 
                        Assistant, Home will now be more capable of directing the right information 
                        to the right connected screen. Say something like: “OK Google, show my calendar 
                        for today” and Home can instantly display your day’s events on a Chromecast-connected 
                        TV. Ask Home for directions to a place or event, and it will send the directions 
                        right to the Google Maps app on your phone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        More than ever, this requires extreme commitment to Google’s products and 
                        services, but that’s sort of the point — Google is betting it can bring all 
                        this stuff together in such an attractive way that you won’t think twice 
                        about buying (or ditching) your Amazon Echo.
                    </p>
                    <h4>GOOGLE PHOTOS ADDS BOOKS AND EFFORTLESS SHARING</h4>
                    <p>
                        Google Photos is getting a slew of great additions. The app will now 
                        recommend that you share photos you’ve taken with people that it recognizes 
                        as being in the shot. Google calls this Suggested Sharing. It’s also 
                        introducing Shared Libraries, which allow families to collectively 
                        add images to a central collection more easily. But Google is emphasizing 
                        control, here: you can share your entire photo library, share only from a 
                        certain date, or share photos that include certain things like your kids.
